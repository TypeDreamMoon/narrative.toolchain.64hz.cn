Quests observe the ledger. After each batch of writes, they check `fail if`, latch satisfied objectives,
and complete when all required objectives are latched. Their state lives in the ledger, so it is
included in save and restore automatically.
Quests with `priority: hidden` start as soon as they become available, which suits clue chains and
hidden endings. `gameplay: Tag` makes the GAS bridge emit that GameplayEvent on completion.
An objective's text is translated under `quest.<Quest>.objective<n>`, numbered from 1 by position;
`show: Text #id` names it `quest.<Quest>.<id>` instead, and `dnc freeze` writes the numbers in.
